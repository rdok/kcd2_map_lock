## Changelog

#### v1.0.0 21-Feb-25

- feat: Save map position (zoom, X, Y) when closing the map.  
- feat: Restore saved map position on opening the map.  
- feat: Full version: Saves position after zooming or adding a checkpoint.  
- note: Game bug - map movement doesn’t trigger save events; only zooming or adding a checkpoint does—use checkpoint to lock your view.
