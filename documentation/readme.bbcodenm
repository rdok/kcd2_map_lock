[size=6]Map Lock[/size]

This mod saves your map spot when you close it, so it reopens right where you left off. There's a game bug, though: it only saves if you zoom or add a checkpoint. Just drop a checkpoint at your spot (it saves the map view, not the checkpoint). Install with Vortex. Drop feedback in the comments!
